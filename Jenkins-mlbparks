  // Publish the latest war file to Nexus. This needs to go into <nexusurl>/repository/releases.

  //
  // You now have two options: Either binary build (streaming the war file into a binary build) or build with external artifacts.
  // If you are unclear which path to follow ask your instructor.
  // 
  // When doing a binary build you are done.
  // 
  // When doing a build with external artifacts (not binary build) you will also need to do the following:
  // - Update the Gogs project openshift-tasks-ocp by editing the .s2i/environment file. This file needs to have a line
  //   WAR_FILE_LOCATION=<actual URL of the war file in nexus>
  // - It is also a good idea to add another line like "BUILD_NUMBER=${BUILD_NUMBER}" to the environment file. Otherwise the
  //   push to Gig/Gogs will fail in case the version number didn't change. ${BUILD_NUMBER} is one of the Jenkins built-in
  //   variables.
  stage('Publish to Nexus') {
    // TBD
  }

  // Build the OpenShift Image in OpenShift. 
  // 1. When doing a binary build make sure to rename the file ./target/openshift-tasks.war to ROOT.war before you start the build.
  // 2. When doing a build with external artifacts make sure to use the build configuration pointing to openshift-tasks-ocp
  //    for the .s2i/bin/assemble script to retrieve the war file from the location in the .s2i/environment file.
  // Also tag the image with "TestingCandidate-${version}" - e.g. TestingCandidate-1.5
  stage('Build OpenShift Image') {
    // TBD
  }

  // Deploy the built image to the Development Environment. Pay close attention to WHICH image you are deploying.
  // Make sure it is the one you just tagged in the previous step. You may need to patch the deployment configuration
  // of your application.
  stage('Deploy to Dev') {
    // TBD
  }

  // Run some integration tests (see the openshift-tasks Github Repository README.md for ideas).
  // Once the tests succeed tag the image as ProdReady-${version}
  stage('Integration Test') {
    // TBD
  }

  // Blue/Green Deployment into Production
  // -------------------------------------
  // Next two stages could be one.
  // Make sure to deploy the right version. If green is active then deploy blue, and vice versa.
  // You will need to figure out which application is active and set the target to the other.
  stage('Prep Production Deployment') {
    // TBD
  }
  // Deploy the ProdReady-${version} image. Make sure this is the actual tagged image deployed!
  // Do not activate the new version yet.

    // TBD
  }

  // Once approved (input step) switch production over to the new version.
